# coffee_spending
Analysis of total spending on coffee from August 2020 to August 2022. The data is taken from a statement of account for the period from August 1, 2020 to August 31, 2022. A two-year statement of account could be a source of a lot of ideas, but here I focus only on spending on coffee, so the project wouldn't be blown out.

With the help of visualization and, if needed, statistical tests I'd like to solve the following problems:
1. Summarize the coffee consumption by month.
2. Did coffee consumption increase or decreased over time?
3. Did I visit the coffee shops more often in winter?
4. What was the average check for coffee and how many visits I made â€“ by month?
5. Break down the coffee consumption by days of the week and find whether I spent the most and visit more often on weekends.
6. What is the percentage of coffee in total expenses?

Initially, <i>Coffee</i> was a part of a greater [project on my total spending](https://github.com/denislsad/personal_spending), but I decided to branch it off as two parts were too unrelated.
